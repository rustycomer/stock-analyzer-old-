# Quandl Python Client 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/quandl/quandl-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/quandl/quandl-python)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/quandl.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/quandl)

This is the official documentation for Quandl's Python Package. The package can be used to interact with the latest version of the [Quandl RESTful API](https://www.quandl.com/docs/api). This package is compatible with python v2.7.x and v3.x+.

## Deprecation of old package

Please see this readme for more information and upgrade instructions: [2.x series transition notes](./2_SERIES_UPGRADE.md)

## Installation

The installation process varies depending on your python version and system used. However in most cases the following should work:

```shell
pip install quandl
```

Alternatively on some systems python3 may use a different pip executable and may need to be installed via an alternate pip command. For example:

```shell
pip3 install quandl
```

## Configuration

| Option | Explanation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| api_key | Your access key | `tEsTkEy123456789` | Used to identify who you are and provide full access. |
| api_version | The API version you wish to use | 2015-04-09 | Can be used to test your code against the latest version without committing to it. |

```python
import quandl
quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = 'tEsTkEy123456789'
quandl.ApiConfig.api_version = '2015-04-09'
```

`quandl.ApiConfig.api_version` is optional however it is strongly recommended to avoid issues with rate-limiting. For premium databases, datasets and datatables `quandl.ApiConfig.api_key` will need to be set to identify you to our API. Please see [API Documentation](https://www.quandl.com/docs/api) for more detail.

## Retrieving Data

There are two methods for retrieving data in Python: the Quick method and the Detailed method. The latter is more suitable to application programming. Both methods work with Quandl's two types of data structures: time-series (dataset) data and non-time series (datatable). 

The following quick call can be used to retrieve a dataset:

```python
import quandl
data = quandl.get('NSE/OIL')
```

This example finds all data points for the dataset `NSE/OIL` and stores them in a pandas dataframe. You can then view the dataframe with data.head().

A similiar quick call can be used to retrieve a datatable:

```python
import quandl
data = quandl.get_table('ZACKS/FC', ticker='AAPL')
```

This example retrieves all rows for `ZACKS/FC` where `ticker='AAPL'` and stores them in a pandas dataframe. Similarily you can then view the dataframe with data.head().

Note that in both examples if an `api_key` has not been set you may receive limited or sample data. You can find more details on these quick calls and others in our [Quick Method Guide](./FOR_ANALYSTS.md).

### Detailed Usage

Our API can provide more than just data. It can also be used to search and provide metadata or to programatically retrieve data. For these more advanced techniques please follow our [Detailed Method Guide](./FOR_DEVELOPERS.md).

## Local Development

### Setup

If you wish to work on local development please clone/fork the git repo and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to setup the project.

### Testing

We recommend the following tools for testing any changes:

* [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for running tests.
* [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox) for testing against multiple versions of python.
* [flake8](https://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for syntax checking.
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for use with tox virtualization.

The following are instructions for running our tests:

1. Make sure a version of python 2.7 or python 3.x is installed locally in your system. To avoid permission issues on OSX we recommend installing the packages from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install `virtualenv` and `tox` using:
    `pip install tox virtualenv`
3. Run following command (you may notice slow performance the first time): 
    `python setup.py install`
4. Run the following command to test the plugin in all versions of python we support:
    `tox`

## Recommended Usage

We would suggest downloading the data in raw format in the highest frequency possible and preforming any data manipulation
in pandas itself.

See [this link](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/timeseries.html) for more information about timeseries in pandas.
